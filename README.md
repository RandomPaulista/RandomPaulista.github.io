# RandomPaulista's Mapping Blog

This site is a portfolio and blog for all my map projects, including the Global Language Organization & Shade System (G.L.O.S.S.).

It is built using custom HTML/CSS/JS and is hosted via GitHub Pages at [randompaulista.github.io](https://randompaulista.github.io).

## Pages

- `index.html`: Homepage with project links and navigation
- `blog.html`: Ongoing updates about development, maps, and linguistics
